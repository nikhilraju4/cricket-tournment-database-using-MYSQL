The proposed Cricket Management system is an automated Management
system built for cricket organizers. The proposed system allows the organizers
to go through the data of various cricket teams worldwide. Less effort is
required for maintaining the database. The margin of errors will be reduced
and keeping track of participating teams will be a breeze.

The database contains details of teams, players, umpires, coaches among
others. All useful information about a tournament can be found in the given
database. It also contains a technical diagram, the Entity Relationship diagram.
